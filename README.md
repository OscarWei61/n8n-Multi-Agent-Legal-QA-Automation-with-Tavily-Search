# n8n-Multi-Agent-Legal-QA-Automation-with-Tavily-Search
This project demonstrates a multi-agent system built with n8n to automate legal question answering. It uses the Tavily web search API to fetch up-to-date legal info, with agents handling tasks like query refinement, search, and response generation. The workflow simulates collaborative legal research for faster, more accurate answers.
